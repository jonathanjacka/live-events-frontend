# Live Events

Frontend for Live Events application, which allows for the basic creating, editing, and viewing of different live music events in a particular area.

See the project live [here](https://live-events.vercel.app/).

## Acknowledgements

Its idea is from project based on the course [Next.js: Dev to Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/) by Brad Traversy. This course will also helpfully walk you through some of the more complicated steps of getting the project deployed with Heroku (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## Usage

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run Application

```
# Run in developer mode
npm run dev

# Run in production mode
npm start
```

## From create-next-app

This project was created in conjunction with [live-events backend](https://github.com/jonathanjacka/live-events-backend), which uses Strapi.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
